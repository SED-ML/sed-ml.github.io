        <h2 id="sedmlProposals">Feature requests and proposals</h2>
        <p>We would like to encourage you to follow the procedure below for contributing to SED-ML development. </p>
        <h3>Feature requests</h3>
        <p>
            Feature requests are “wishes for support” by SED-ML users. They are submitted and tracked using the
            <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2074517" target="_blank">feature request tracker</a>. The
            <a href="about.html">SED-ML editors</a> will revise these wishes at their regular meetings and start discussion on
            them <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sed-ml-discuss" target="_blank">sed-ml-discuss</a> if necessary.
            Solutions to feature requests can be provided (independently of a feature request) by starting a new proposal item.

        </p>

        <h3>Proposals</h3>
        <p>
            Proposals are welcome at all times via the sourceforge <a
                href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2074517" target="_blank">proposals
            tracker</a>. Proposals could be derived from a
            sed-ml-discuss discussion field (for example, in response
            to a feature request), or created de novo.

        <ul>
            <li>Together with your proposal you must provide a
                sufficiently detailed description of your desired
                feature, including XML examples, i.e. SED-ML files,
                containing the proposed new elements in Annotation
                elements. Final element and attribute names may be
                decided on later (maybe even hierarchy).
            </li>
            <li>The editors then collect vote on whether the
                outlined proposal goes in to the right direction and
                should become part of SED-ML.

                <ul>
                    <li>The proposal will be voted on by sedml-discuss
                        members,
                    </li>
                    <li>requiring a majority in favour to be accepted.
                        The vote includes yes-no-revise options.
                    </li>
                    <li>There will be no minimum requirement for the
                        the number of votes needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>The voting process will take place over a 3
                        week period.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Proposals that are rejected will not be rejected
                for all time, but would need to address the reasons
                for their rejection before resubmission. Resubmission
                therefore requires revision of the proposal.
            </li>
            <li>Accepted proposals will be integrated with the
                specification document by the SED-ML editors with the next release.
                Prerequisites are:

                <ul>
                    <li>at least two implementations in applications (
                        to demonstrate interoperability)
                    </li>
                    <li>updated examples</li>
                    <li>a written description of the proposal</li>
                </ul>
                and ideally would include:

                <ul>
                    <li>an XML schema for the proposed extension</li>
                    <li>UML diagrams illustrating any new class</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
