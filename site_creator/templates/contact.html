            SED-ML is a <b>community project</b> that is under continuous development.<br />
            The SED-ML community
            comprises simulation software developers and modelers from the
            different communities applying computational methods on biology,
            medicine, neuroscience etc.

                The official mailing list for the SED-ML project is sed-ml-discuss.
                The mailing list is free for everyone to join. It is the place
                where all issues regarding the SED-ML language are being discussed.
                Announcements of SED-ML related events and support issues are
                posted on SED-ML disucss. Requests for new SED-ML features should
                be made through the mailing list also. Another important function
                of the mailing list is the voting for SED-ML editors, as well as
                for SED-ML proposals. Write and subscribe to the <a
