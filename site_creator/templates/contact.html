            SED-ML is a <b>community project</b> that is under continuous development, involving software developers of
            various simulation tools and model
            representation formats. Our effort values all opinion and contributions. If you have a question,
            want to discuss the evolution of SED-ML, want to voice an opinion, write and subscribe
            to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sed-ml-discuss" target="_blank">sed-ml-discuss</a>.

        <p>
            SED-ML is part of the <a href="http://co.mbine.org/">COMBINE</a>
            effort. The SED-ML community meets twice a year in person, at the annual
            COMBINE meeting and at the annual HARMONY meeting. In addition there are regular online meetings.
