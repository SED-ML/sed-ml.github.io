  text:       'libSedML is a set of .NET libraries for supporting SED-ML. The core
                        library libSedML supports reading, validating and writing of SED-ML descriptions, along
                        with all necessary utility functions for resolving models and XPath expressions. Two
                        additional libraries are included: libSedMLRunner, which allows to schedule and execute
                        simulation experiments encoded in SED-ML files using either RoadRunner# (Bergmann et
                        al., 2006) or a variety of simulators exposed through the Systems Biology Workbench
                        (SBW, Bergmann et al., 2006a) like iBioSim (Myers et al., 2009) and COPASI (Hoops et
                        al., 2006). A third library, libSedMLScript, provides a script based language for
                        defining SED-ML experiments.'
